# Node Blog API Best Practices

Uses _Passport_ and _JWT_ for authorization. Uses _Express_ and _MongoDB_ as the backend.

The reason for this code along project is learn how to write production grade code instead of some ametuerish code.

Learned how to avoid callback hell, setting up _ES6_ in _Express_, a lot of _MongoDB_ and _Mongoose_ etc.

Learned how to set up _ESLint, Webpack, Babel_ in a project from scratch which is also useful in my _React_ projects.

To use it, just run the following commands.

`yarn install`
`yarn dev:build`
`yarn dev:server`

If all goes well, you must be ready to use the API :-)

This is a pretty extensive API and so, Use this [link](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0636f578392ba03645c6) in _Postman_ to access collection of all the testable API.
